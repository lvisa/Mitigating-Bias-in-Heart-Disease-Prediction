# Mitigating-Bias-in-Heart-Disease-Prediction
In this project, we apply a Random Forest Classifier to predict heart disease using the Heart Dataset, which includes 302 observations and a variety of clinical parameters. Initially, our model performed well for females, achieving a 94.12% recall rate, but was less effective for males. To address this imbalance, we conducted a comprehensive audit of algorithmic bias, adjusting training data weights and the male decision threshold to 0.3. 

These changes significantly improved male recall rates without reducing female accuracy, promoting gender equity in our results. This effort demonstrates the essential role of healthcare and artificial intelligence in developing accurate, ethically sound predictive models. We are committed to continually refining our algorithms to ensure AI advancements provide substantial, fair benefits to all stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and insurers, fostering an environment where AI tools deliver critical, unbiased support in healthcare.
